"In music, the term 'cadence' has several meanings. In harmony we are going "
"to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function it is "
"to create a sensation of either stability, rest and ending, or of pause, "
"tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of "
"punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark "
"breathing places and pauses in music, they serve to structure the musical "
"phrases and they also help to establish tonality. Listen for example to the "
"following three chords:"

"You will notice the feeling of conclusion, of reaching the end of a musical "
"piece. The chord sequence does not create expectations of continuation. The "

"with finishing at that point. On the contrary, listen to the following chord "
